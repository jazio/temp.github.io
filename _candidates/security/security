    The biggest dangers come from the possibility of political change — we’re putting in powers and infrastructure that could easily be badly misused by a future government… These powers are actually better suited for monitoring and controlling political dissent than catching criminals and terrorists — they’re ideal for an authoritarian clampdown should a government wish to do that. A future government might well.

# Wi-fi Leakings

Don’t Forget to Turn Off Your Wi-Fi. Wi-fi spots do spy on you. Moreover they can be turned into stingrays.

When you turn Wi-Fi on for your device, it will search for a AP to connect to in “active scanning” mode. In order to do that it will show your MAC address to nearby APs. This is a physical address associated with your specific device. Once connected to the hotspot you are granted an IP address that will allow you to connect to the internet. So there are two identification methods; your MAC address between you and the AP, and your IP address between you and the internet.

A Stingray is a “fake cell tower” that can intercept cellphone communication. They then link this to you by using your SIM card’s International Mobile Subscriber Number (IMSI). This was only possible using cellular network connections and not Wi-Fi.

A keyring is a secured "stored database" of your login information stored a removable media. It's wrapped by encryption schema (PKCS#11).
