Encrypt tar.gz file on create

Pack your_dir in a encrypted archive your_archive.tgz.gpg (symmetric encryption):

```
tar -cz your_dir | gpg -c -o your_archive.tgz.gpg
```
Unpack it:

gpg -d your_archive.tgz.gpg | tar xz

See the docs of GPG for how to use asymmetric instead of symmetric encryption.
